# Data Community DC Diversity Statement and Code of Conduct

## Diversity Statement

Data Community DC believes that diverse communities are better and stronger. Together, we continue to build an inclusive culture that encourages, supports, and celebrates diversity in race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and all protected classes. It connects and brings us closer. Everyone is welcome to come, speak, and volunteer as an inclusive community.

## Code of Conduct

Data Community DC is made up of an assortment of professionals and volunteers with different backgrounds. This diversity is one of our strengths, and Data Community DC is dedicated to providing a diverse and inclusive community experience for everyone. Data Community DC prohibits any form of discrimination, bullying, or harassment at all events.

Harassment includes, but not limited to:

    Unwelcomed conduct that is based on: race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic.
    Offensive physical actions, written or spoken, and graphic communication (for example, obscene hand or finger gestures or sexually explicit pictures).
    Any type of physical contact when the action is unwelcomed by recipient (for example, intentionally brushing up against someone).
    Expectations, requests, demands or pressure for sexual favors.
    Slurs, jokes, posters, cartoons, and gestures that are offensive.
    Sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Bullying includes, but not limited to, one or more of the following forms:

    Verbal abuse.
    Offensive behaviors that are threatening, humiliating or intimidating.
    Work interference or sabotage that prevents work from getting done.

If a community participant engages in bullying or harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and events. If you are harassed, notice harassment or offensive activities, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately. Participants asked to stop any bullying or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors of community events are also subject to the anti-bullying and anti-harassment policy and in particular, should not use offensive images, activities, or other material. In addition, Representatives from sponsor organizations should not use offensive clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create an offensive, intimidating, hostile, or unwelcoming environment.

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for minor problems, although a community organizer should speak to the presenter afterward. If a presentation or event repeatedly or seriously violates this Code of Conduct, the community organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop the presentation or event. (For example, simply say “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time” with no further explanation.)

We value your participation, and want you to feel comfortable, safe, and supported.

    To report any form of harassment or to seek immediate help, contact any of the Data Visualization DC organizers present.
    To file a police report, contact 911.
    For immediate support in case of sexual assault, contact the DC sexual assault hotline at (202) 333-RAPE.
    If you need a safe ride, Red Top Cab can be reached at (703) 522-3333.

We expect participants and organizers to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related social events.

It is through thoughtful dialog and careful listening that we can encourage each other to do great things. We are committed to making Data Community DC a place where you can develop and share your skills and passion around data visualization.
